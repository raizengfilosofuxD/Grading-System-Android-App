### 1.1 Background of the Study
The Programmerâ€™s Project decision is influenced by their lead team Programmer Mr. Sangalang wherein he want to dedicate and offer the project for his alma mater and to his beloved Values Education teacher Mrs. Rheamay T. Paras. The reason why the programmer wants to choose this
kind of project or system is that because they want to improve the grading system in an updated and latest technology in the 21st Century age of learning in The Angeles City National High (the company) 
The ground cause of the system is that the Angeles City National High
School has a system that they record their grades manually in their Log Book
or Record Book to keep the grades but the programmers/researchers found
out that this kind of system can cause a too much time of transferring the
grades to the Worksheet Software. The Programmers decided to make a new
handy grade recorder and that can be used to record easily and not manually
in their record book.
